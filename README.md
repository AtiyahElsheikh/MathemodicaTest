Description
-----------

All unit tests of Modelica libraries currently developed or needed by Mathemodica.com are gathered here for practical reasons regarding saving duplicated efforts across e.g.\  

1. Different non-related git-branches of a Modelica library corresponding to several Modelica platforms
2. Different Modelica simulation environments loading this library with their own platform-specific Modelica implementation 
3. Co-related Modelica libraries e.g. via extension or those using common base components 
4. In particular different algorithmically differentiated Modelica libraries
